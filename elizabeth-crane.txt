Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Inline elements do not start on a new line. Block elements start on a different line, and take up all 
space available within their part of the box.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
An absolute position means that the element will always be in the same place, relative to its closest
positioned ancestor. So, if you had a static image, an element given absolute position to the upper right
of that static image, would always appear on the upper right of that image despite changing screen size or
scrolling.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
.example {
  display: inline;
  width: [value];
}

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default
   and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	Block:
		<address>
		<blockquote>
		<section>
	Inline:
		<span>
		<a>
		<img>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, 
   how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
-The box model a series of boxes that surround every html element:

		------------------top--------------------
		|  --------------margin---------------	|
		|  |	---------border----------    |  |
                |  |    |    ----padding----    |    |  |
		|  |	|    |	[content]  |    |    |  |
   		|  |	|    ---------------    |    |  |
		|  |	-------------------------    |  |
 		|  -----------------------------------  |
		-----------------------------------------

-You can "fix" the boxel model using different sizing rules to change things like the different
pixel and percentage values of the different box segments.
